    <h1><u>Remarks</u></h1>
    <ul>
    <li class="lirem">Paper was not easy to understand and adequeate explanation was not found on online resources as well</li>
    <li class="lirem">Incomplete algorithm implementation in paper(eg. only top bottom contours given no explanation for sides)</li>
    <li class="lirem">Ambiguity in terms of practical implementations of theoratical functions was not very intuitive which led to project freezing at multiple times </li>
    <li class="lirem">Difficult to have a unified approach amongst team mates due to online mode of collaboration</li>
    </ul>

    <h1><u>Coding challenges</u></h1>
    <ul>
    <li class="lirem">Data structure selection for stripes and set operations as each plausible option had its own set of pro's and cons</li>
    <li class="lirem">In functions like copy, blacken the operation of searching required defining superset of an interval</li>
    <li class="lirem">Implementation of CTree data structure & acc. to the Paper only top, bottom are defined and we had to develop our own version of the algorithm to get the side contours as well</li>
    <li class="lirem">Plotting of graphs in Python Libraries and creating visible contours of the same</li>
    <li class="lirem">Passing by References in set containers of STL & ensuring values are flushed out everytime required to satisfy Divide & Conquer Paradigm </li>
    </ul>
